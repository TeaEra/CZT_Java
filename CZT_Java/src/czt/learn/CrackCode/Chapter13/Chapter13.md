> C++ vs Java

1. Java runs in a virtual machine;
2. C++ natively supports unsigned arithmetic;
3. In java, parameters are always passed by value (or, with objects, their references are passed by value);
In C++, parameters can be passed by value, pointer, or by reference;
4. Java has built-in garbage collection;
5. C++ allows operator overloading;
6. C++ allows multiple inheritance of classes;
